# Knight's Travails

A _Knight_ in chess can get to any other square on the board given enough moves. The goal of this project is to write a function that takes a starting square and a destination square, and then returns the shortest path from start to destination.

# Thoughts

This project introduced me to graphs (specifically undirected and unweighted), and provided me with a deeper understanding of performing breadth-first-search. This was a very complicated project for me to visualize and to get started with.
